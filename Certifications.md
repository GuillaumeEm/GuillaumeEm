# Why certifications ?

I would like to switch to a full-time DevOps/SRE career path. Since 2015, I have mainly held developer or software engineer positions with systems-related duties on the side. This makes it difficult for me to attest some of my abilities.

I'm not a huge fan of flashing badges and shiny certifications, but I feel that they can open doors for me in the corporate environments I am targeting for freelance missions. A discussion with an ex-boss convinced me to consider this option, and worst case scenario, I will learn something along the way.
