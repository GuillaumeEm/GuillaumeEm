# Certifications

I would like to work more towards the DevOps/SRE spectrum of things. Since 2015, I have had a significant amount of systems-related duties, and it is something that I have come to appreciate more, of course, I will always enjoy creating things.
Certifications will help me reach that end goal, and I am sure that I will learn a ton of new things.
