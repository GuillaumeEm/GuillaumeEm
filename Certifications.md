# Certifications

I would like to switch to a full-time DevOps/SRE career path. Since 2015, I have mainly held developer or software engineer positions with systems-related duties on the side. This makes it difficult for me to attest some of my abilities.

I'm not a huge fan of certifications, but if it can open doors, why not ? I was convinced to consider this option, and worst case scenario, I will have learn something along the way.
